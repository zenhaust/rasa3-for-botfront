### Before GO !!!
This rasa fork can not run in standalone mode.<br>
It's a part of [botfront-for-rasa3](https://github.com/djypanda/botfront-for-rasa3) project.<br>
It requests configurations from botfront-for-rasa3 backend service. And also use botfront backend service as a response and track server.

### Run in docker

1. Get the sourcecode
```bash
git clone https://github.com/djypanda/rasa3-for-botfront.git
cd rasa3-for-botfront
```
2. Build the docker image
If you run into some build errors due to the network connection problem (especially in cn), just run this command again.
```bash
docker build -t rasa3-for-bf:v0.1 -f docker/Dockerfile.botfront .
```
3. Check the image
```bash
docker images
```
You should get a output like this:
```
REPOSITORY             TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
rasa3-for-bf           v0.1      3e604ad10384   43 seconds ago   2.33GB
